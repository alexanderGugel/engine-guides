<span class="intro-graf">
Welcome to the Famous platform guides. These guides cover all the concepts you need to know to start using the Famous platform.
</span>

## Diving in

The best place to start, if you're brand new to Famous, is the guide on [Getting Started](/get-started.html). If you want to see a quick overview of Famous with minimal overhead, see the [hello Famous](hello-famous.html) section.

## Getting help

If you're stuck on a problem or confused by a concept, visit our slack channel ( [see: the Support section for details](http://famous.org/support/) ), where you'll find both community members and Famous platform engineers on hand to answer questions and troubleshoot.

## Giving feedback

We'd love it if you'd get in touch with us at [learn@famo.us](mailto:learn@famo.us). If you've found a typo, caught an error in one of our examples, or just want to tell us how we're doing overall, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
