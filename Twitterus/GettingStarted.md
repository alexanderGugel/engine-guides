Before we start coding, let's look at how to download and install Famous so you can develop on your local workstation.

_If you'd rather dive in first and learn about setup later, skip ahead to the [Creating an App section](CreatingAnApp.html)._

## Twitterus Seed Project

For simplicity, we've provided a Twitterus Seed Project that you can fork with the Famous CLI and use to follow along with the lesson.  First, [install the CLI](http://famous.org/get-started.html).  Then, run:

    $ famous fork twitterus-tutorial
    $ cd lesson-twitterus-starter-kit
    $ famous dev

The app will be running from a local webserver at [localhost:1618](http://localhost:1618).
