title: Twitterus Lesson
---

<span class="intro-graf">Let's build "Twitterus", your own microblog app, with the Famous platform. You'll learn the Famous fundamentals as we create a simple, four panel application that transitions between sections.</span>

Transitions bring life to applications and, in this lesson, you'll see just how easy it is to add them to a project. Follow along as we architect a basic app and set up buttons to navigate between sections with tween animations.
