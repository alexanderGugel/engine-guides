title: What's Included

<span class="intro-graf">
Our banner animations will span over a 12 second period. During this time,  many elements will appear and disappear off the page with various effects. To help build this type of ad, we've included two useful modules: **View** and **Timeline**.
</span>

**View**

The View module is a class that creates a new HTML element and adds components to it. What makes this module helpful is that it only imports the components that it needs based on the methods you call. With it, we can create and modify multiple elements with very few lines of code.

</div>

**Timeline**

The Timeline module helps queue up and organize multiple animations. By registering a component with Timeline, you can set its values at specified intervals and easily sync up animations. This module will let us coordinate our intro and outro animations over the 12 second period.

The two modules above are not part of the Famo.us Platform; However, we have included them in the [Visa Black Lesson starter kit](https://github.com/Famous/lesson-visablack-steps) to build our ad more quickly. In the next step, we will look at the other files included in the kit and use those to start building our banner.
