title: Build a flashy VISA<sup>&reg;</sup> ad with Famous
---

<span class="intro-graf">
In this lesson, we will build a mobile-friendly, interactive banner ad with the Famous platform.
</span>

We'll teach you how to add dynamic elements to a banner and how to cue multiple animations using a Timeline. This lesson will replicate an actual Flash ad for the VISA<sup>&reg;</sup> Black Card to create banner the below.

 

<div class="famous-container" data-famous-container-identifier="1c425aa6-b91d-45ef-a7cb-d5fca3b2a58c" style="display: block; position: static; width: 300px; height: 600px; margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
  <script src="https://demo.famo.us/hub/container/embed.js"></script>
</div>


Currently most ads are either static or not compatible across devices. However, since Famous is built entirely in Javascript, we can create interactive ads that will work in browsers big and small. Follow along and we'll teach you how to bring smooth, 60fps animations back to your banner ads. 

This lesson assumes you've already completed the Carousel lesson. Make sure you're familiar with the following concepts before continuing:

  - Famous Context & Scene Graph
  - Famous Components
  - Famous Sizing & Positioning
  - Javascript "Classes" & Context
