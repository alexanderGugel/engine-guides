<span class="intro-graf">
Before we start coding, let's look at how to download and install Famous so you can develop on your local workstation. For simplicity, we've provided a [carousel starter kit](#).
</span>

In following sections, we will create the child classes for our Carousel. The image below illustrates where instances from these classes will appear and the objects that will carry them.

To keep things tidy, let's create a new file for each class. 

Add files for **Arrow**, **Pager**, and **Dots** so your file structure looks like this:

    main.js
    Carousel.js
    Arrow.js
    Pager.js
    Dots.Js

<div class="sidenote">
<p>At the end of each section, <strong>look for the section recap</strong>, where we'll provide links to the completed files, a live demo showing the current state of the code, and additional resources to browse.</p>
</div>
